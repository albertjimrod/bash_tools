This repository contains scripts designed to automate Conda environment management tasks, which I have found essential for my workflow.

The most important functionalities include:

- Exporting Conda environments: This allows me to save the current state of a Conda environment so it can be easily transferred.
- Importing Conda environments: This enables me to quickly and reliably move Conda environments from one machine to another, ensuring consistency in development and production setups.

These scripts help streamline my workflow by reducing the time spent on manual setup and configuration tasks.
