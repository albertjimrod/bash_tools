## 🔍 buscar_git.sh — Find Git Repositories on Your System

This Bash script helps you locate all directories containing a Git repository — specifically, any directory that has a `.git` subdirectory.

---

### 📂 What is it for?

If you have many projects scattered across your system and want to know which ones are Git repositories, this script will help you quickly and easily find them.

---

### 🧾 Usage

```bash
./buscar_git.sh [DIRECTORY]
```

- If no directory is specified, it will search from the current directory (`.`).
- If a directory is provided, it will recursively search within it.

#### 🔧 Examples

```bash
./buscar_git.sh
```

Searches recursively from the current directory.

```bash
./buscar_git.sh /home/youruser/projects
```

Searches all Git repositories inside `/home/youruser/projects`.

---

### 🛠️ Recommended Setup

1. Save the script in a directory like `~/scripts/` or `~/bin/`.
2. Make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x buscar_git.sh
   ```

3. (Optional) Add that directory to your `$PATH` so you can run it from anywhere:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/scripts:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

---

### 📄 Script Code

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Base directory to search in (defaults to current directory)
BASE_DIR="${1:-.}"

echo "Searching for Git repositories in: $BASE_DIR"

# Look for directories named .git
find "$BASE_DIR" -type d -name ".git" 2>/dev/null | while read gitdir; do
    # Print the parent directory of .git
    echo "Git repository found in: $(dirname "$gitdir")"
done
```

---

### 🧼 Notes

- The script suppresses error messages (`2>/dev/null`) to avoid clutter such as "Permission denied".
- It doesn’t verify the validity of the `.git` folder (although it's usually fine); for stricter checks, the script could be extended.
